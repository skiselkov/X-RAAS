-- This is the X-RAAS configuration file. Everything on a line following
-- a double dash (--) is a comment and is ignored by X-RAAS.
-- You can uncomment the following clauses below to override how X-RAAS
-- interacts with your simulator.
--
-- You must put this file into one of two places in your X-Plane 10
-- installation to make sure X-RAAS sees it:
--	*) <X-Plane 10>/Resources/plugins/FlyWithLua/Scripts/X-RAAS.cfg
--	*) <X-Plane 10>/Aircraft/<Your Aircraft>/X-RAAS.cfg
--
-- X-RAAS loads the files in this order, so any changes you make in an
-- aircraft's X-RAAS.cfg overrides what is in the global X-RAAS.cfg in
-- your Lua Scripts directory, which in turn overrides X-RAAS's hard-coded
-- defaults. This way you can have personalized settings in the global
-- X-RAAS.cfg file and just tailor them to a particular aircraft in the
-- aircraft's X-RAAS.cfg.

-- ** Uncommenting the following line disables X-RAAS. RAAS is primarily
-- ** designed for airliners, and is a poor match for things such as
-- ** aerobatic aircraft or helicopters.
-- RAAS_enabled = false

-- ** By default X-RAAS reads out runway length remaining in thousands of
-- ** feet. By uncommenting the line below, X-RAAS will read out runway
-- ** length remaining in increments of 300 meters.
-- RAAS_use_imperial = false

-- ** Uncomment to make X-RAAS grow a pair.
-- RAAS_voice_gender = "male"

-- ** This is the minimum runway length (in meters) remaining that X-RAAS
-- ** will consider to be safe for conduting a takeoff. If an aircraft lines
-- ** up on a runway with less than this distance remaining, X-RAAS will
-- ** append a "XXXX REMAINING" message to the "ON RUNWAY" annunciation to
-- ** notify the pilot of potentially insufficient runway length remaining
-- ** for the takeoff roll and will also generate a "SHORT RUNWAY! SHORT
-- ** RUNWAY!" annunciation if the takeoff roll (acceleration past 40 knots
-- ** ground speed) is initiated on such a runway.
-- RAAS_min_takeoff_dist = 1000

-- ** This is the minimum runway length (in meters) remaining that X-RAAS
-- ** will consider to be safe for conduting a landing. If an aircraft
-- ** lines up for landing on such a runway and passes below 470 feet above
-- ** field elevation, X-RAAS will append a "CAUTION! SHORT RUNWAY! SHORT
-- ** RUNWAY!" to the "APPROACHING XXX" annunciation to notify the pilot of
-- ** potentially insufficient runway length remaining for rollout.
-- RAAS_min_landing_dist = 800

-- ** If a takeoff is aborted or an aircraft has touched down and is slowing
-- ** down, X-RAAS will generate runway length remaining annunciations. This
-- ** parameter enables you to put an upper boundary (in meters) on the
-- ** runway length remaining, beyond which no annunciations will be
-- ** generated (i.e. runway length remaining is so large that it doesn't
-- ** warrant bothering the pilot about it). The default and maximum value is
-- ** 3000 meters, but you can set it lower, in case your aircraft has much
-- ** shorter landing rollouts (e.g. don't annunciate runway length remaining
-- ** beyond 1600 meters).
-- RAAS_accel_stop_dist_cutoff = 3000

-- ** X-RAAS monitors the selection of landing flaps on approach to landing.
-- ** This parameter is defined as the minimum "flaprqst" dataref value
-- ** (relative flap handle position from 0.0 for flaps up to 1.0 for full
-- ** flaps down) that is considered valid landing flaps. If the aircraft is
-- ** lined up with the runway and flaps are set to less than this value and
-- ** the aircraft descends thru 950 feet above field elevation, X-RAAS
-- ** generates a "FLAPS! FLAPS!" annunciation. If flaps remain above this
-- ** limit past 600 feet AFE, X-RAAS generates a second "FLAPS! FLAPS!"
-- ** annunciation. Finally, descending thru 470 feet AFE without flaps in
-- ** the landing configuration, X-RAAS generates a "UNSTABLE! UNSTABLE!"
-- ** annunciation.
-- ** To completely disable this annunciation, set RAAS_min_landing_flap = 0
-- RAAS_min_landing_flap = 0.5

-- ** Same as RAAS_min_landing_flap, but takeoff. If the aircraft lines up
-- ** on a runway and flaps are set to less than this value, X-RAAS appends
-- ** a "FLAPS! FLAPS!" message to the "ON RUNWAY" annunciation. It won't
-- ** generate any further annunciations after takeoff is initiated, as
-- ** most airliners contain a takeoff configuration horn, which will notify
-- ** you plenty of your mistake. This RAAS annunciation is simply to
-- ** prevent the takeoff configuration horn warning, as that necessitates
-- ** aborting the takeoff.
-- ** To completely disable this annunciation, set RAAS_min_takeoff_flap = 0
-- RAAS_min_takeoff_flap = 0.1

-- ** Same as RAAS_min_takeoff_flap, but is an upper bound on the valid flap
-- ** setting for takeoff.
-- ** To completely disable this annunciation, set RAAS_max_takeoff_flap = 1
-- RAAS_max_takeoff_flap = 0.75

-- ** Aircraft are not normally meant to hold on runways for extended periods
-- ** of time. If an aircraft has been sitting still (less than 3 knots ground
-- ** speed) on a runway for an extended period of time, X-RAAS generates
-- ** 'reminder' "ON RUNWAY" annunciations. It generates the first such
-- ** annunciation after RAAS_on_rwy_warn_initial number of seconds (by
-- ** default 60). Then it generates further "ON RUNWAY" annunciations every
-- ** RAAS_on_rwy_warn_repeat seconds (by default 120). To prevent
-- ** excessive annoyance to crews having to hold on the runway for extended
-- ** periods of time, it will stop after having made a total of
-- ** RAAS_on_rwy_warn_max_n annunciations (by default 3). If the aircraft
-- ** moves on the runway (accelerates past 3 knots ground speed), this timer
-- ** and message counter is reset.
-- RAAS_on_rwy_warn_initial = 60
-- RAAS_on_rwy_warn_repeat = 120
-- RAAS_on_rwy_warn_max_n = 3
