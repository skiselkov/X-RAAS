-- This is the X-RAAS configuration file.
--
-- Everything on a line following a double dash (--) is a comment and is
-- ignored by X-RAAS. You can uncomment the following clauses below to
-- override how X-RAAS interacts with your simulator. To uncomment a line,
-- simply remove the leading double dashes '--'. The parameters are simply
-- pairs of:
--
--   <name> = <value>
--
-- Uncommenting a parameter activates that change in X-RAAS (you need to
-- reload your FlyWithLua scripts or reload the airplane). Otherwise the
-- parameter will remain at its default value.
--
-- You must put this file into one of two places in your X-Plane 10
-- installation to make sure X-RAAS sees it:
--	*) <X-Plane 10>/Resources/plugins/FlyWithLua/Scripts/X-RAAS.cfg
--	*) <X-Plane 10>/Aircraft/<Your Aircraft>/X-RAAS.cfg
--
-- X-RAAS loads the files in this order, so any changes you make in an
-- aircraft's X-RAAS.cfg overrides what is in the global X-RAAS.cfg in
-- your Lua Scripts directory, which in turn overrides X-RAAS's hard-coded
-- defaults. This way you can have personalized settings in the global
-- X-RAAS.cfg file and just tailor them to a particular aircraft in the
-- aircraft's X-RAAS.cfg.
--
-- The X-RAAS configuration parameters are listed below with explanations
-- what they do.



--	Uncommenting the following line disables X-RAAS. RAAS is primarily
--	designed for airliners, and is a poor match for things such as
--	aerobatic aircraft or helicopters.
--	Default value: true

-- RAAS_enabled = false



--	By default X-RAAS reads out runway length remaining in thousands of
--	feet. By uncommenting the line below, X-RAAS will read out runway
--	length remaining in increments of 300 meters.
--	Default value: true

-- RAAS_use_imperial = false



--	Uncomment to make X-RAAS grow a pair.
--	Default value: true

-- RAAS_voice_female = false



--	This is the minimum runway length (in meters) remaining that X-RAAS
--	will consider to be safe for conduting a takeoff. If an aircraft lines
--	up on a runway with less than this distance remaining, X-RAAS will
--	append a "XXXX REMAINING" message to the "ON RUNWAY" annunciation to
--	notify the pilot of potentially insufficient runway length remaining
--	for the takeoff roll and will also generate a "SHORT RUNWAY! SHORT
--	RUNWAY!" annunciation if the takeoff roll (acceleration past 40 knots
--	ground speed) is initiated on such a runway.
--	Default value: 1000

-- RAAS_min_takeoff_dist = 1000



--	This is the minimum runway length (in meters) remaining that X-RAAS
--	will consider to be safe for conduting a landing. If an aircraft
--	lines up for landing on such a runway and passes below 470 feet above
--	field elevation, X-RAAS will append a "CAUTION! SHORT RUNWAY! SHORT
--	RUNWAY!" to the "APPROACHING XXX" annunciation to notify the pilot of
--	potentially insufficient runway length remaining for rollout.
--	Default value: 800

-- RAAS_min_landing_dist = 800



--	If a takeoff is aborted or an aircraft has touched down and is slowing
--	down, X-RAAS will generate runway length remaining annunciations. This
--	parameter enables you to put an upper boundary (in meters) on the
--	runway length remaining, beyond which no annunciations will be
--	 generated (i.e. runway length remaining is so large that it doesn't
--	warrant bothering the pilot about it). The default and maximum value is
--	3000 meters, but you can set it lower, in case your aircraft has much
--	shorter landing rollouts (e.g. don't annunciate runway length remaining
--	beyond 1600 meters).
--	Default value: 3000

-- RAAS_accel_stop_dist_cutoff = 3000



--	X-RAAS monitors the selection of landing flaps on approach to landing.
--	This parameter is defined as the minimum "flaprqst" dataref value
--	(relative flap handle position from 0.0 for flaps up to 1.0 for full
--	flaps down) that is considered valid landing flaps. If the aircraft is
--	lined up with the runway and flaps are set to less than this value and
--	the aircraft descends thru 950 feet above field elevation, X-RAAS
--	generates a "FLAPS! FLAPS!" annunciation. If flaps remain above this
--	limit past 600 feet AFE, X-RAAS generates a second "FLAPS! FLAPS!"
--	annunciation. Finally, descending thru 470 feet AFE without flaps in
--	the landing configuration, X-RAAS generates a "UNSTABLE! UNSTABLE!"
--	annunciation.
--	To completely disable this annunciation, set RAAS_min_landing_flap = 0
--	Default value: 0.5

-- RAAS_min_landing_flap = 0.5



--	Same as RAAS_min_landing_flap, but takeoff. If the aircraft lines up
--	on a runway and flaps are set to less than this value, X-RAAS appends
--	a "FLAPS! FLAPS!" message to the "ON RUNWAY" annunciation. It won't
--	generate any further annunciations after takeoff is initiated, as
--	most airliners contain a takeoff configuration horn, which will notify
--	you plenty of your mistake. This RAAS annunciation is simply to
--	prevent the takeoff configuration horn warning, as that necessitates
--	aborting the takeoff. To completely disable this annunciation, set
--	RAAS_min_takeoff_flap = 0
--	Default value: 0.1

-- RAAS_min_takeoff_flap = 0.1



--	Same as RAAS_min_takeoff_flap, but is an upper bound on the valid flap
--	setting for takeoff. To completely disable this annunciation, set
--	RAAS_max_takeoff_flap = 1
--	Default value: 0.75

-- RAAS_max_takeoff_flap = 0.75



--	Aircraft are not normally meant to sit on runways for extended periods
--	of time. If an aircraft has been stationary (less than 3 knots ground
--	speed) on a runway for an extended period of time, X-RAAS generates
--	'reminder' "ON RUNWAY" annunciations. It generates the first such
--	annunciation after RAAS_on_rwy_warn_initial number of seconds (by
--	default 60). Then it generates further "ON RUNWAY" annunciations every
--	RAAS_on_rwy_warn_repeat seconds (by default 120). To prevent
--	excessive annoyance to crews having to hold on the runway for extended
--	periods of time, it will stop after having made a total of
--	RAAS_on_rwy_warn_max_n annunciations (by default 3). If the aircraft
--	moves on the runway (accelerates past 3 knots ground speed), this timer
--	and message counter is reset. To completely disable runway holding
--	detection, set RAAS_on_rwy_warn_max_n = 0. This does not disable the
--	'on runway' annunciation when initially lining up.
--	Default values: 60 (initial), 120 (repeat), 3 (max_n)

-- RAAS_on_rwy_warn_initial = 60
-- RAAS_on_rwy_warn_repeat = 120
-- RAAS_on_rwy_warn_max_n = 3

--	When an aircraft is on approach to land and the database indicates
--	an optimum approach angle, X-RAAS monitors the approach angle and
--	if the angle drifts to over 1.6x optimum angle (but no more than 8
--	degrees), it will issue three warnings: 'TOO HIGH! TOO HIGH!' descending
--	through 950 to 700 feet AFE, a second 'TOO HIGH! TOO HIGH!' descending
--	through 600 - 470 feet AFE, and finally a 'UNSTABLE! UNSTABLE!'
--	descending through 470 - 220 feet AFE.
--	Uncommenting the line below will disable these warnings.
--	Default value: true

-- RAAS_too_high_enabled = false


--	X-RAAS monitors your altimeter setting to prevent forgetting to reset
--	the barometric altimeter subscale to QNE above transition altitude and
--	back to QNH or QFE when below transition level. Forgetting to set the
--	appropriate altimeter setting can result in incorrect flight level
--	(increasing risk of traffic collisions) or in a CFIT (Controlled Flight
--	Into Terrain). The real world RAAS interacts with the FMS of the
--	aircraft to determine origin and destination aerodromes and sets up its
--	transition altitude and transition level based on what's set in the FMS.
--	X-RAAS obviously can't interface with 3rd party FMS addons, so it
--	instead attempts to guess the transition altitude/level based on
--	database entries for the airports around the aircraft, as well as GPS
--	elevation and barometric indications. It doesn't always get this 100%
--	right, so if you don't want to deal with this indication, uncomment
--	the parameter line below.
--	Default value: true

-- RAAS_alt_setting_enabled = false
